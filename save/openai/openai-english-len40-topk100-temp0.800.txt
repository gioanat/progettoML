and still ... the world seemed to turn from black to black . the sound of water lapping against stone came through the tunnel , and though it might as well have been miles away , the sound made her

" no , " she said , shaking her head . " nothing . i just do n't do romance . i never have . " he grinned . " oh , that 's rich . " "
her face turned to stone . she held out a hand in my direction . " you have business on the night table , " she said . " follow me . " the bathroom was empty , and

i almost laughed because i actually could n't imagine why she was in the hospital . a little pain of no consequence was nice right now . " you , sir , are being released , " the nurse
with that thought , she turned away . " what ? " he asked as all ten of them stood up for the girl . why did n't she say or do something to get the attention of everyone
he rolled his eyes . " i was never going to speak to you again . " " why not ? " he shrugged . " the point is , my father did n't want you , so
" your daughter died , " she was n't even sure he heard her , he 'd gone quite still . " she was being attacked by some evil monster , " his mouth told her , " and
" i had to leave town . i came back here , and i had to go to my aunt 's place for a while because my father ... " she trailed off , choking off the painful confession .
the next she woke up . a little bit too early for a weekend . or an entire weekend actually . the reality of that caused her heart to squeeze in agony . where was she ? and
" i do n't get it . why are n't you working ? " cassie pressed . every few feet a man or an aide would cut her off , and she would duck out of the way .
" how do you know ? " he asked . " i 've been known to have conversations with a doctor , a retired one at that . which one ? " he sat up straighter and leaned
" why 'd you do this ? " i ask . to the last person i need to remember . " because i love her . i was n't doing anyone a favor by killing her . "
" are you sure you 're okay , darling ? " " yes , thanks . i 'm fine . some cuts and bruises , but no break . i think i 'm all that 's left . "
" a dragon ? " she choked . " it 's a very , very powerful one . you wo n't hurt him . you wo n't need the pain too much . " " that 's not
" why ? " his eyes caught mine . he was n't about to give me the answer i wanted , but i took his hands and put them on my waist . " yes , " i said
" oh great , " i mutter under my breath . i do n't even think to turn toward him ; the look he gives me makes me just a bit uncomfortable . " okay , then why would n't
" no , it 's as good as always . " he smiled . " but we 'd better get you out of this mess before your neighbors take one look at you . " " my neighbors would

" yes , i see . i 've got the photo . " " thanks , " she said , and hung up . she looked back at the photo . " you know she 's quite pretty
" oh . - yes , i do . there 's one for everyone right now . " that was true . she could feel the hunger building once more , the need for control , for power .
" you do n't like me ? " he could feel his heart hammering wildly , hammering like the drums above . he felt certain it was a trick of the blood running through his veins , pounding faster and
" what the hell are you talking about ? " she shrugged . " what have i done ? " still furious . " why ? " " how would you know ? you 're practically sleeping

the smell of oranges , clo ves and cinnamon permeated the crisp air . i found myself nodding enthusiastically . finally , i was in control of the situation . " yeah , i see how it looks like .
" no thank you . i 'll call ... i 'll call her later . i feel dirty . " she rose from the table and turned to the men . " it was nice to meet you all .
" this is n't my scene . these ' scenes ' are for other clients that i do n't want to see , " he said , but his eyes showed his impatience . he could keep her safe ,

i stepped gingerly through the doors . it was dark inside , much darker than the rest of the car , but i could see perfectly . only the outline of people waited for me inside . on one side
" what do you think , jo ? " garrett asked . " if there is one person who 's always at this dinner - who knows my wife - then that 's it . " " well ,
" i have been thinking about that . i have a very nice feeling about you , " he smiled , and then he had a flash of something a man could never have . he was actually smiling .

tom and clay both went to the old men 's bathroom , where a bowl of macaroni and cheese - three different kinds - sat on the sink 's edge , and clay dumped them both in the basin .
" who 's he then ? " i whispered . " has he seen the baby yet ? because i 'm getting very concerned . " " no , of course not ! " lilly 's voice quivered slightly

" no , there 's no need for you . " she said , " we 're just going to talk while we walk . " the two of them started walking the dirt road that led to the
' you must go , ' she said , and there was something in her voice that surprised him . she would not have commanded him to leave ; but there was a kind of weariness in her face .
as she lay in the bed beside him in the small hours of the morning , she could have sworn she heard him whispering , " i love you . " the words were the last thing she heard before
