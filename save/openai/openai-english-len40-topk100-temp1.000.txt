it 's the day of their party . jack 's parents , her father , and the town 's mayor , her mother and sister . her mother will be acting their part and getting everyone into position .
the man who rode beside her waved from his post as they started across the open floor . the crowd of people continued to shift in their seats as they made their way through the gathering . "
i closed my eyes and tried to keep my feelings to myself , but they were difficult to hold . i was upset that he 'd left , more than happy that he 'd returned to the real world

" yes , it is . you just have to learn to trust your instincts . " " how do you do that ? " " that we 're just that , right . nothing more . "
she took a deep breath and tried to think clearly . now had to face what she 'd come here to do . with a tremor in her fingers , she drew a few steps forward , and then two
" so it 's a date ? " " i will be , " i whispered . she kissed me almost too hard . " tell me when you get home , " she said . "

he had to be a child 's dream , a fantasy , a desperate quest for her love all his own . he could n't leave her . she would turn into a monster when she knew what
" i 'm leaving , " she said . " i 'll tell you when i 'm ready . " " never , " he insisted , his blue eyes beseeching her now . a smile broke out
