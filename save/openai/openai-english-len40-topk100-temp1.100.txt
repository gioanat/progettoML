i stood still at the foot of her bed and watched her sleep . for a long time , i did n't move . she woke <EOS> , she woke at the night , in bed , <EOS>
" you wanna , but let 's wait a bit , just in case ... " i turn around to face him and drop his hand , " oh , do n't worry , i wo n't mention it
" yeah , i was kind of surprised when you told us what happened . we 're still getting back to that . why are you and him so ... " the look he gave me said more than his

" hello , my girl . " and with that , the man kissed me and wrapped his arms around me , hugging me close to his body . i struggled to move away from his grasp . "
his face creased with a pained look , " well , i heard ... before i did . " " and what ? " i asked , suddenly curious . he glanced from the two in the back

he was tall but not as tall as the men , their heads nearly touching their chins as they stood in tight circles , which gave them the appearance of giant boulders . one man stared fixedly past jason .
i had promised myself i would be the real rock chick of the band , though , so i needed to tread carefully as ty and i took turns calling the shots . the man was the captain ,
" do not be afraid , sire , " he said . " they are not as evil or as wicked as those who serve us . they are not like the rest of you , not like the dragons

then he took a sip of his wine , and looked out through the window again . the rain had stopped , but it still pelted the glass . he leaned back in his chair , resting his head
" good at least , do n't do that . " she warned . " do n't do what ? " he asked the same maid sitting behind him with a cup of coffee . " order breakfast
i pulled a pillow over my face , wanting to just shut out the pain of not seeing him . i had been able to think for a while . i had been able to think out loud what
" are you all right ? " " fine . " she tried to laugh it off . " not feeling too great , anyway . " " maybe you should start packing , " he said softly

it was as if the sun was being blotted out as i looked up , out from behind the cloud cover . i was surprised to see that it was much brighter than i remembered . i saw clouds around
" when did you take the money ? what is it with you ? " i asked , growing angrier to have her speak in the presence of two of her family members . although i did n't believe she
" we do n't have much time , " he said , still looking at the black marble ceiling . " i would like to get her out and back to her pack before the others get to her .
" no , i think you 've already noticed . it 's getting harder and harder to move away from you . " " it 's getting harder and harder , ty it 's freaking impossible ! "
" i need a break , " i said , giving a sarcastic salute to the two ladies who had taken me in with the promise of getting me a great job . " it 's getting late , and
" we have to get out of here . right now , " david says . i watch his hand tighten around the stake before lowering his hand . " now we do , " he says . then
my eyes went from the laptop screen to my phone , " when i went home i forgot - " " how many times has he asked you to go to see him ? " so i could

" i know , i know , " alex said . " but ... that last kiss ... i did n't know it was supposed to be an act . i mean , it was supposed to be so .
i shook off his arm and rushed out . it was true , because when i looked back , he was making our way down the hall , and i was already out of breath from my run . just

" is it hard for you to be close ? " his tone became distant . " yes , but ... " " wait , i 'm sorry ; i did n't mean it like that . "

" you 're talking about the ' one guy in two hundred million is a prime candidate for me . ' " " exactly . " " i do n't know where your head is at , but

now that he 'd answered and the tears were streaming down his face , grace stopped crying , but the pain in her chest was still there . still there , but just underneath the surface . she could n't
do n't look at me like that . i did n't know what the hell she was talking about until she 'd told me she had a boyfriend . and i knew exactly what she was talking about . brandon
" i ca n't help it , " i say . " i want my chance . my one chance , after all the shit i 've been through . " i nod over at our cabin . " so
my cell rang at that moment . she was on home territory with someone , probably jeff . where is she ? checking the screen on my phone , i read his name back to me . it
and it sucked worse than any time before , except when he slipped into his mind there was little he could learn about the woman at the door . but then , she made a habit of keeping the strangest
" yes , ma'am , " he spoke with a voice that was gruff and distant . " not my fault , ya know ? " then a smile slipped across me , and i hoped it was n't
the door shut with a soft click behind her . a voice said , " that is absolutely one of the prettiest things i 've ever heard . " she did n't want to turn around , but
so now what do i do ? did i push or did he push back ? did he say he missed me ? not likely . unless he wanted me to - unless he wanted an opportunity to do it
" you 're going to tell me that this is not true ? " tom asked , but he knew he was wrong and would forever regret not going . " what does this mean ? i mean , i
i look into her warm eyes that make me feel beautiful and healthy , like i did n't need coffee and nothing else . when she smiles , i smile back , remembering all the times i watched her smile
' do you know how this feels , liz ? ' he asked softly . it made a beautiful sense of peace to her . even though she knew that the love of her life was already dead
" did i get any sleep or in that fight ? " i asked the obvious answer . " very little while you were out , angel . i do n't think you slept much in bed because you
" is that so ? " one of the older members asked . " then is she a lady in green gab ble ? " emma blushed and dropped her head , afraid to look their way . "
" in your bed now . " he pulled as much flesh free as he could from the bruises and abra sions as he could bear . " no more , lauren . let go . " she did
" well , then , " he said with an awkward grin , " may i continue ? " i nodded , waiting in the hall , wondering what the hell he really had come for . i was
and then , no matter how hard i tried to think of it , as images of that scene , the one that came into my head , played out like it had been played that night in my office
on impulse , she smiled . this was an odd way to play into the people 's hands - and by go lly , she was damned good at it . " oh , sure , " she said
" do you ? " " i do . " he took two steps forward . " you want me to believe that ? " i did n't know what to say , but i nodded that
his voice vibrated on the cold air , a clear reminder of just how cold and empty her world was inside . " there is still time , " he said , his tone suddenly serious . so
" uh - oh . what the hell is wrong with him ? " she asked , obviously nervous . " his expression . " " oh , yeah . but what 's wrong ? " "
well , not a lot of them . i 'm not really even a genius . he had n't even figured that out yet , yet . i hope he does n't have a panic attack . because if he

she gave it time . and they waited . her hand eased deeper between his legs , finding his straining length . his breath grew ragged . she knew the moment when it was over

and he went for it . " i 'm not here to sleep with you . " he rolled onto his side , facing me but he still had my hands in his and he kept moving them
