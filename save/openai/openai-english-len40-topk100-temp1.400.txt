the night was cool and quiet . the only people out and about were the two boys in the garden making a game out of setting the flowers . beth knew this morning did n't make any sense .
" so , you 're really not going to tell me what 's going on ? " alex finally asked . i was ready to sit down to eat , but he still kept keeping his distance .
" fine . " " no , thanks . i have to get back into training . " " okay , i 'll just ... " i shake my head and sigh . how does one respond to
